A tile based RPG game, with path-finding, enemies, allies, random item drops with stats, and other features.

### About

This was a University project created in 2010/2011. It was programmed with C# and uses the Microsoft XNA framework - depoyable to Windows and Xbox 360. It may be useful for anyone that wishes to create their own 2D tile-based game, or wish to see how path-finding algorithms can be implemented into their game. Feel free to use any code you want!
