## About

This was a University project created in 2009/2010, which uses the Microsoft XNA framework. It was depoyable to Windows and Xbox 360. 
Unfortunately these are only the remnants of the project. This was extracted from a raw backup file, and all sprites, images, sounds, and folder structure has been lost. However, it seems that the main game logic stil remains.
Feel free to extract any parts you want, or you can even try to piece it back together if you wish!
